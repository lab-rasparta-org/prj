* DONE Start documenting.
The start of the documentation process.
Also, the start of the webpage.

* DONE Share.
Using GitHub for hosting, since the gh-pages is a convenient way to do it.

* DONE Create an icon.
And the favicon.

* DONE Insert the icon into the webpage floating in the upper left corner.
And the favicon in the propper section - in the <head> of the page.
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" sizes="16x16 32x32 48x48 64x64" type="image/vnd.microsoft.icon">

* DONE Don't download the zip file. Download the tarball.
Make use of the propper GitHub API for that.

* DONE Add a link to the TODO file.
Maybe on the main page.

* DONE Add a link to the rss feed.
https://github.com/lab-rasparta-org/prj/commits/master.atom

* DONE Fix the heigth of the iframe.
It should stretch to the bottom of the visible page.
It's working in some browsers, not older ones.

* DONE Fix the distance of the header to the top of the visible page.
The icon should be at the same distance form the top as it is form the left.

* DONE Unfold the main page into more options.
Like giving the option to download the tarball, the zip file or just the prj script.
The idea would be to display an intermediary menu in which to choose what to do next. The examples page needs this badly, as soon as more content is added.
Also added some more options, like the option to download just the prj file or both: zip and tar files... It was a complete remake, really!

* DONE Add a nice 404 page.
