* DONE Start documenting.
The start of the documentation process.
Also, the start of the webpage.

* DONE Share.
Using GitHub for hosting, since the gh-pages is a convenient way to do it.

* DONE Create an icon.
And the favicon.

* DONE Insert the icon into the webpage floating in the upper left corner.
And the favicon in the propper section - in the <head> of the page.
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" sizes="16x16 32x32 48x48 64x64" type="image/vnd.microsoft.icon">

* TODO Don't download the zip file. Download the tar.gz one.
Make use of the propper GitHub API for that.

* TODO Fix the heigth of the iframe.
It should stretch to the bottom of the visible page.
It's working in some browsers, not older ones.

* TODO Fix the distance of the header to the top of the visible page.
The icon should be at the same distance form the top as it is form the left.
